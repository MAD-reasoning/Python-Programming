""" Write functions that add, subtract, and multiply two numbers in their digit-list representation (and return a new
digit list). If you’re ambitious you can implement Karatsuba multiplication. Try different bases. What is the best base
if you care about speed? If you couldn’t completely solve the prime number exercise above due to the lack of large
numbers in your language, you can now use your own library for this task."""
